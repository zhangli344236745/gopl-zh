# 附录B: 勘误

**p.9, ¶2:** for "can compared", read "can be compared".
    (Thanks to Antonio Macías Ojeda, 2015-10-22.)

**p.13:** As printed, the <code>gopl.io/ch1/lissajous</code> program
is deterministic, not random.  We've added the statement below to
the downloadable program so that it prints a pseudo-random image
each time it is run. (Thanks to Randall McPherson, 2015-10-19.)

`rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())`

**p.19, ¶2:** For "Go's libraries makes", read "Go's library makes". (Thanks to Victor Farazdagi, 2015-11-30.)

**p.40, ¶1:** The paragraph should end with a period, not a comma. (Thanks to Victor Farazdagi, 2015-11-30.)

**p.43, ¶3:** Import declarations are explained in §10.4, not §10.3. (Thanks to Peter Jurgensen, 2015-11-21.)

**p.52, ¶2:** for "an synonym", read "a synonym", twice.


**p.68:** the table of UTF-8 encodings is missing a bit from each first byte.
The corrected table is shown below.  (Thanks to Akshay Kumar, 2015-11-02.)
  
```
0xxxxxxx                             runes 0?127     (ASCII)
110xxxxx 10xxxxxx                    128?2047        (values <128 unused)
1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx           2048?65535      (values <2048 unused)
11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx  65536?0x10ffff  (other values unused)
```

**p.74:** the comment in <code>gopl.io/ch3/printints</code> should say
`fmt.Sprint`, not `fmt.Sprintf`.


**p.76:** the comment `// "time.Duration 5ms0s` should have a closing double-quotation mark.


**p.79, ¶4:** "When an untyped constant is
assigned to a variable, as in the first statement below, or
appears on the right-hand side of a variable declaration with an
explicit type, as in the other three statements, ..." has it backwards:
the <i>first</i>
statement is a declaration; the other three are assignments.
(Thanks to Yoshiki Shibata, 2015-11-09.)

**p.132, code display following ¶3:** the final comment should read:
`// compile error: can't assign func(int, int) int to func(int) int`
(Thanks to Toni Suter, 2015-11-21.)

**p.166, ¶2:** for "way", read "a way".

**p.362:** the `gopl.io/ch13/bzip` program does not comply with the [proposed rules for passing pointers between Go and C code](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/12416-cgo-pointers.md) because the C function `bz2compress` temporarily stores a Go pointer (in) into the Go heap (the `bz_stream` variable). The `bz_stream` variable should be allocated, and explicitly freed after the call to `BZ2_bzCompressEnd`, by C functions. (Thanks to Joe Tsai, 2015-11-18.)
